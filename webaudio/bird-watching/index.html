				<h2>Common Moorhen</h2>

				<div class="row">
					<div class="span6">
						<h3>
							Identification
						</h3>
						<p>
							Moorhens are most similar to Coots but smaller, the fleshy 
							shield on their forehead is red, not white, and they have 
							obvious white markings under the tail and in a narrow line
							along the body. At closer range, the plumage is not completely 
							black but has shades of browns and greys.
						</p>

						<h3>
							Behavior
						</h3>
						<p>
							Moorhens are frequently seen jerking their heads to-and-fro 
							like an Egyptian dancer, or flicking up their under-tail 
							feathers to make a white 'V' sign to intruders. It is not 
							uncommon for a Moorhen to 'dump' one or more eggs in the 
							nest of another Moorhen which will then rear the chick as 
							if it were its own.
						</p>

						<h3>
							Migration
						</h3>
						<p>
							Southerly birds tend to be either resident or dispersive 
							while northern birds are partially migratory, moving southwards 
							after breeding.

				<h2>Laughing Gull</h2>

				<div class="row">
					<div class="span6">
						<h3>
							Identification
						</h3>
						<p>
							Laughing Gulls are medium-sized gulls with fairly long wings and long legs 
							that impart a graceful look when they are flying or walking. They 
							have stout, fairly long bills.
						</p>

						<p>
							Laughing Gulls are medium gray above and white below. Summer adults have 
							a crisp black hood, white arcs around the eye, and a reddish bill. In winter, 
							the hood becomes a blurry gray mask on a white head. 
						</p>

						<h3>
							Behavior
						</h3>
						<p>
							Laughing Gulls eat almost anything, including food they catch or steal, 
							handouts, garbage, and discards from fishing boats. They often congregate 
							in parking lots, sandy beaches, and mud bars. Listen for their nasal,
							strident calls in flight, while feeding, and at rest.
						</p>

						<h3>
							Migration
						</h3>
						<p>
							Laughing Gulls are a coastal species and are only occasionally 
							seen very far inland. Look for them in plowed fields, garbage dumps,
							 parking lots, and shorelines. They nest, often in large numbers, on 
							 islands near the shore but safely isolated from terrestrial predators.

				<h2>Chuck-will's-widow</h2>

				<div class="row">
					<div class="span6">
						<h3>
							Identification
						</h3>
						<p>
							The surprisingly large Chuck-will’s-widow has a huge flat head and long wings. 
							It's significantly larger than Common Nighthawk and Whip-poor-will. 
						</p>

						<h3>
							Behavior
						</h3>
						<p>
							Calls at dusk, pre-dawn and at night. Chuck-will’s-widows often sit on the road and 
							roadsides at night, where you'll occasionally spot them in headlights. Their eyes 
							reflect a bright orange eyeshine. Also, sometimes seen at dusk gliding over trees 
							giving their wing-clapping display or while hunting. 
						</p>

						<h3>
							Migration
						</h3>
						<p>
							Look for Chuck-will’s-widow roosting in dry woodlands in the southeast, 
							from pine barrens to oak-hickory and mixed deciduous woodlands.

				<h2>Red-bellied Woodpecker</h2>

				<div class="row">
					<div class="span6">
						<h3>
							Identification
						</h3>
						<p>
							All red-bellied woodpeckers show a black-and-white barred back, white uppertail coverts, grayish white underparts, 
							black chevrons on the lower flanks and undertail coverts, and barred central tail feathers. In flight a small 
							white patch shows at the base of the primaries. Adult male: entire crown, from bill to nape, is red; there is 
							a suffusion of pink or red on the center of the belly. Adult female: red on the head is limited to nasal tufts 
							(just above the bill) and nape; wash of color on the belly is paler, less extensive. In rare individual females, 
							the nape and nasal tufts can be yellow-orange instead of red. Juvenile: resembles adults but duller, with red 
							nasal tuft and nape patches lacking; bill is brownish (black in adults).
						</p>

						<h3>
							Behavior
						</h3>
						<p>
							Look for Red-bellied Woodpeckers hitching along branches and trunks of medium to large trees, 
							picking at the bark surface more often than drilling into it. Like most woodpeckers, these birds
							have a characteristic undulating flight pattern.
						</p>

						<h3>Habitat</h3>
						<p>
							Red-bellied Woodpeckers are common in many Eastern woodlands and forests, from old stands 
							of oak and hickory to young hardwoods and pines. They will also often venture from forests 
							to appear at backyard feeders.
