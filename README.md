Web Workers - November 15, 2012
Feeling lazy?  Join us to learn how to offload all your tiresome computations and 
other weighty tasks to a web worker.  While the web worker computes, you sit back, 
relax, and get on with more pressing matters in the browser.  Itâ€™s as easy as 
computing pi to ten thousand digits.
