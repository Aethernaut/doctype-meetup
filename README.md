Dissecting WebGL - June 22, 2013
-------------
directory: /dissecting-webgl

WebGL is a magical graphics leprechaun that lives inside good web browsers. 
It’s the permissible spawn of OpenGL, which is a big unicorn that eats code and shits pixels.

Taming WebGL will allow you to create GPU accelerated graphics, physics and 
image effects that can run on desktop and mobile browsers without any plugins. Nice.

This little leprechaun speaks an ancient language though, generally forgotten 
in Frontendland and despite it’s computational and rendering dexterity, it’s 
quite shy and will often appear obtuse and quite frankly very unforthcoming 
about why it’s being such a disobedient little shit.

Join Huge and Justin Windle as we ply this volatile gremlin with treats and 
make it dance for us. We’ll learn what he really is, what he’s good for, 
dissect his digestive system (aka the pipeline) and ruminate how to listen to his 
faintly mumbled complaints. Then, whilst grasping the whip of compliance, we’ll 
command him to draw shapes, process images, render 3D objects and create particle 
effects at staggering speeds.



Web Audio API - April 18, 2013
-------------
directory: /webaudio

It’s time to delete that bgsound from your body tag, and explore 
the all new Web Audio API. This is way more than the basic audio 
tag, it’s an API for processing and synthesizing audio in web 
applications. Come make some noise with us as we explore the 
coolest HTML5 feature you’ve never heard of!


Web Workers - November 15, 2012
-------------
directory: /webworkers

Feeling lazy?  Join us to learn how to offload all your tiresome computations and 
other weighty tasks to a web worker.  While the web worker computes, you sit back, 
relax, and get on with more pressing matters in the browser.  It’s as easy as 
computing pi to ten thousand digits.


Let's take this offline... - October 13, 2011
-------------
directory: /offline-storage

Tired of web applications that don’t remember your name in the morning? Tired of
getting to the airport only to find your digital boarding pass is trying to reload 
the page but you have no internet connection. Say goodbye to basic cookies and hello 
to the future of native storage.

Whether you want to publish your new high score in Tetris when you get off the 
subway, or merely reduce latency in your fancy web application, new features 
like app cache, indexed db, or the filesystem api will change the world of online 
applications that we know today. Join us for brews and a whole lot of code 
samples as we delve deep into HTML5’s new storage APIs and show some practical 
examples of how to use them in today’s world.

We found a real lack of tangible examples of how to use HTML5’s offline storage 
components so we decided to put together our own instead of wait for everyone 
else in the industry to catch up. 


CSS Transitions, Transforms, and Animations round-up - February 23, 2011
-------------
directory: /transitions-transforms-animations

Let's get our CSS3 on! ... or HTML5 as the W3C would call it..., and talk 
about these emerging techniques for animating the web. We'll look at the big picture of 
how these technologies work, where you can use them now, decoupling presentation and 
behavior, dive into some code examples, and toss the buzz words in the trash.
